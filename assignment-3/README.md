# [Assignment-3: Implementing K-Means using MapReduce from scratch](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vQ6UvQzah5o2mcVjFpb6llZrOaqPz6PiQ4m_7zYlRDeYdHWJ77ziYN22-HyE0VDnHBxojsHPnqu1nf7/pub)

## Setup Instruction

### Install Requirements

$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Steps to run the Map-Reduce based k-means algorithm 

1) Check the config.yaml for the configuration of the Map-Reduce framework. Adjust the IP:Port values for mappers/reducers key based on the number of mapper/reducer nodes you want to run. 
 
2) Run Mapper/s Node: 
$ python3 mapper.py -I 0 (0: Mapper Node ID) 

3) Run Reducer/s Node:
$ python3 reducer.py -I 0 (0: Reducer Node ID) 

3) Run Master Node: 
$ python3 master.py 

4) Check Data folder for output generated by Mapper and Reducer jobs and thecentroids.txt for the final output generated.
